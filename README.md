## Understanding Keyloggers
Keyloggers can be:
- Hardware-based (physical devices)
- Software-based (like this demonstration)
- Kernel-level (hard to detect)

## Detection Techniques
### Behavioral Analysis
1. Check for:
   - Unusual network connections
   - Unexpected processes
   - Suspicious DLL injections

### Tools
```bash
# Windows:
Process Explorer - Check process tree
TCPView - Monitor network connections

# Linux:
sudo lsof -i
sudo lsmod

Prevention Methods
System Hardening

    Enable Secure Boot

    Use application whitelisting

    Disable unnecessary services

Browser Protections

    Use browser sandboxing

    Install NoScript extension

    Disable JavaScript for sensitive sites

Remediation

If infected:

    Disconnect from network

    Run offline scans

    Reinstall OS if necessary

    Change all credentials


### Implementation Notes:
1. **Sound Effects**: The base64 audio is truncated in the example. For full implementation, you'd need to add proper sound files.

2. **Animations**: All animations are pure CSS/JS with no external dependencies.

3. **Terminal Simulation**: The terminal documentation section simulates real command-line usage.

4. **Security Warnings**: Multiple prominent legal notices are included.

5. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.

To complete setup:
1. Save the HTML as `index.html`
2. Save the README as `README.md`
3. Save the defense guide as `DEFENSE.md`
4. Add any sound effect files in a `/sounds` directory

This complete package now includes all requested features with proper security warnings and educational documentation.
